# Beavis and Butt-Head Simulator

## Disclaimer: this project is for fun and is not particularly well coded.

Exactly what it says on the tin: simulates Butt-Head's dirty mind and Beavis's pyromania.

The b\_and\_b\_constant.cr program uses a constant version of the word array, while  b\_and\_b_variable.cr use a variable version of the word array.

Someday I intend to write an interactive version. Someday...
